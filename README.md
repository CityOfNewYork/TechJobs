# Tech Jobs Website
NYC Tech Jobs is the City's initiative to highlight critical roles for developers, data analysts, and designers in City government. This is part of our effort to “rebrand” working for City government as an unparalleled opportunity to solve complex urban challenges, create massive impact, and learn new skills. You can visit the live site here: www.nyc.gov/techjobs

# Website Framework
The website is built on Bootstrap (www.getbootstrap.com) - an extremely easy-to-use HTML/CSS/JS framework. We're also using Designmodo's FlatUI - a CSS style added on top. Lastly, we're using open-source icons from www.flaticon.com.

# Use it for Your City!
We want you to use or modify this website for your city.
