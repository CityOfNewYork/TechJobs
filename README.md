#Tech Jobs Website

NYC Tech Jobs is the City's initiative to highlight critical roles for developers, data analysts, and designers in City government. This is part of our effort to “rebrand” working for City government as an unparalleled opportunity to solve complex urban challenges, create massive impact, and learn new skills. You can visit the live site here: [NYC Tech Jobs](http://www.nyc.gov/techjobs).

##Website Framework

The website is built on [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), an extremely easy-to-use HTML/CSS/JS framework. We're also using [Designmodo's FlatUI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/), a CSS style added on top. Lastly, we're using open-source icons from [Flat Icon](http://www.flaticon.com).

##Use it for Your City!

We want you to use or modify this website for your city. If you're GitHub-savvy, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for your organization. If you just want to download the code as a ZIP file, click Download ZIP at the bottom of the right-hand navigation bar.

Either way, shoot us a note at dseliger@cto.nyc.gov!
